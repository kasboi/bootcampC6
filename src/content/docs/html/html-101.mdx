## HyperText

When you think of a website, imagine a collection of pages interconnected via links. **Hypertext** refers to text that links to other texts or resources. Unlike regular text, hypertext contains clickable links (called **hyperlinks**) that take you to other pages, sections, or external resources when clicked.

**Example:**  
[Clicking this link will take you to Google](https://www.google.com)

This link is an example of hypertext.

## Markup

**Markup** refers to special tags used to structure, format, and display content on a webpage. These tags don't directly appear on the final webpage, but instead, they tell the browser how to arrange and display the content. In HTML, we use tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<img>` to define headings, paragraphs, and images.

## Language

A **language** is a tool for communication. In this case, we use **HTML** to describe and display the content of a webpage using various markup tags.

**NOTE:** HTML is **NOT** a programming language..

## Starting a New Project

:::note[live server]
Ensure you have installed the Live Server extension before proceeding. You should see the `Go Live` text at the bottom panel if it was successfully installed.
:::

To ensure consistency, follow these steps to set up a central folder for all your projects in this bootcamp:

1. Create a new folder in the `Documents` directory. Name it something like `projects` or `bootcamp`.

   :::info
   If your project name contains spaces (e.g., `my project`), use underscores instead: `my_project`.
   :::

2. Inside the newly created folder, create a subfolder called `html_basics`.

<FileTree>
- Documents 
  - bootcamp 
    - **html_basics.html**
</FileTree>

3. Open **VS Code**.
4. Open the `html_basics` folder in VS Code and create a new HTML file named `index.html`.
5. Type `!` and press **Tab** (this is an **Emmet** shortcut, a built-in VS Code tool for fast code generation). This generates the basic HTML structure for you.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
