title: HTML Beyond Basics

## Going Forward...

We have covered some of the most used HTML elements and attributes over the past few lessons, and there are still more to know—but for now, we'll be pressing on into styling using CSS.

However, we will still cover these topics later on in the future as we keep developing various webpages. Some of these topics include:

1. [HTML Block & Inline](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)
2. HTML [Entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) & [Symbols](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_symbols.asp)
3. [Favicons](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp)

I attached the links to these topics so that you may check up on them ahead of their use. I also recommend W3Schools' HTML [style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) to learn more about the proper way to write HTML and common pitfalls.
