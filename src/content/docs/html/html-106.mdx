## Signup Form

Create a signup form to collect basic user information. Your form should include the following fields:

1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Email Address
4. Password
5. Date of Birth
6. Submit Button
7. Reset Button
8. Dropdown Menu (e.g., select your favorite color, food, or sport)

Take some time to research the most appropriate HTML input types for each of these fields. This will help you understand how to use different form controls effectively.

## States, Capitals & Mottos

Use the HTML `<table>` element to list **at least five states in Nigeria**, along with their **capitals** and **state mottos**.

Bonus points if you apply some basic CSS styling to your table or form.  
Even small touches like borders, padding, or background colors make a big difference!
