## HTML Semantic Elements

HTML is used to define the content and structure of a webpage. As developers, it's important to structure our websites in a **machine-readable** way—that is, in a way that clearly conveys the meaning of each part of the page.

For example, the `<form>` tag is **semantic** because it clearly indicates that it contains form elements. Another example we've already seen is the `<table>` tag, which is used for tabular data.

On the other hand, tags like `<div>` and `<span>` are **non-semantic**. Just by looking at them, it's hard to understand what purpose they serve in the document.

Here's an example using non-semantic HTML:

```html
<div>
  <span>Three words</span>
  <div>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <div>five words</div>
  </div>
<div>
  <div>three words</div>
  <div>forty-six words</div>
  <div>forty-four words</div>
</div>
<div>
  <div>seven words</div>
  <div>sixty-eight words</div>
  <div>forty-four words</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
  <span>five words</span>
</div>
```

Just by reading the code above, it's difficult to understand what each section represents.

Now here's a **semantic** version of the same structure:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Three words</h1>
  <nav>
  <a>one word</a>
  <a>one word</a>
  <a>one word</a>
  <a>one word</a>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <header>
    <h1>five words</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>three words</h2>
    <p>forty-six words</p>
    <p>forty-four words</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>seven words</h2>
    <p>sixty-eight words</p>
    <p>forty-four words</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>five words</p>
</footer>
```

As you can see, semantic elements make the code much easier to understand—both for humans and machines.

### Why Use Semantic HTML?

Using semantic HTML provides several benefits:

- **Improved accessibility** - screen readers and assistive technologies can better understand the content
- **Better SEO** - search engines can more accurately index your pages
- **Cleaner structure** - improves code readability and maintenance
- **More consistent rendering** - browsers can better interpret the intent behind the content

## Common Semantic Elements

Here are some semantic tags you'll frequently encounter:

- `<section>`
- `<header>`
- `<nav>`
- `<footer>`
- `<main>`
- `<article>`

By their names, you can likely guess their purpose. While they behave similarly to `<div>` in layout, they carry **meaning**, which is essential for accessibility and SEO.

There are over 50 semantic elements in HTML. We'll gradually explore them throughout the course.
