## What Do Web Developers Do?

Before deciding to take this program, you probably felt a spark of curiosityâ€”and maybe even did a bit of researchâ€”about what web development is all about.

In essence, a **web developer builds and maintains websites**. They typically work with clients who want to bring their products and services online. These clients can be tech companies (like Meta or Amazon), organizations (such as Jumia or Konga), or even government agencies (like NCDC or NHIS).

Web development might be a great fit for you if you enjoy solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies. Trust meâ€”there's always something new and exciting popping up, from cutting-edge frameworks and libraries to evolving accessibility standards.

## Types of Web Developers

### Frontend Developer

This is everything you see when you visit a websiteâ€”whether it's a social media app like Facebook or Twitter, an e-commerce site like Jumia or Amazon, or even a school portal.
Frontend development focuses on presenting content and includes things like navigation bars, news feeds, buttons, and animations.
Frontend developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks, to make sure websites look great and provide a smooth, engaging user experience.

### Backend Developer

Backend development deals with everything happening behind the scenesâ€”on the server. This includes managing interactions between users, handling posts on your news feed, managing product inventories, and processing payments.
Backend developers use programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript (Node.js) to work with servers, databases, and APIs.

### Full-Stack Developer

Full-stack developers are comfortable working on both the frontend and backend. They can build entire web applications from start to finish, bridging the gap between how things look and how they function.
