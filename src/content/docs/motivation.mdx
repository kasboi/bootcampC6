## Why This Matters

Learning to code is one of the most rewarding decisions you can make—but let's be real: it's not always easy. You'll face tough bugs, confusing concepts, and moments where you wonder if you're cut out for this.

But here's the truth: you are.
Like any valuable skill, coding takes time, effort, and persistence. You don't master it in a weekend. It's a journey of constant growth.

## What's Your “Why”?

Everyone starts this journey for different reasons. Maybe you want to:

- Build a career that pays well and feels fulfilling

- Create things that live on the web

- Turn your app idea into reality

- Launch your own startup

Whatever it is—remember your reason. That motivation will push you through the tough days and give you a goal to aim for.

## Growth Mindset

How you think about learning _matters_—a lot.

People with a **fixed mindset** believe they either "get it" or they don't. If something's hard, they assume it's just not for them.

But people with a **growth mindset** understand that every struggle is a step forward. They believe skills are built—not born—and they know that effort and grit lead to results.

> **Struggling with something doesn't mean you're failing—it means you're growing.**

So when you're stuck on a bug, a project, or a new concept, tell yourself:

> “I may not get this _yet_, but I will.”

### How to Get the Most From This Bootcamp

Here's how to set yourself up for success:

1. **Engage actively.** Take notes, ask questions—use channels like WhatsApp, Google Classroom, or Slack.
2. **Try first.** Attempt every task before asking for help. That's how real learning sticks.
3. **Practice consistently.** Coding is like working out—repetition builds muscle.
